Triton:
i have an idea.. what if you read the bitmap into an array of bytes, then say, write them into another array backwards, and then save that as a file.. the only problem is it would take a long time to unscramble them when you needed them..


Timbo:
As for encrypting a bitmap...
You could run it through an XOR filter. Open the file in binary mode, read each byte and XOR it with a secret number and save it to another file. The file will be complete gibberish until you run it through the XOR filter using the same number. There are countless variations on this scheme.

The pseudocode would look like this:
  Open bmpFile
  Open EncryptFile
  Do While Not EOF(bmpFile)
    Read #bmpFile,,NextByte
    NextByte = NextByte XOR SecretNumber
    Put #EncryptFile,,NextByte
  Loop
  Close #bmpFile, #EncryptFile

Zer:
It's slow, but here yer go
Open a file and make a temp file to save it to
for every byte to encrypt go blah$=chr$((asc(blah)+1 Mod) 255)
and to decrypt subtract 1 from the asc value and change all -1s to 255
simple but it kinda works hehe

Notes:
Have a program for encypting. Then in the client: Decrypt, read into DCs, and Encrypt again.



[Encryptor]

Sub EncryptImage(ImageFile)
  Dim NextByte

  Open ImageFile For Binary As #1
  Open Encrypt.bmp For Binary As #2

  Do While Not EOF(#1)
    Get #1, ,NextByte
    NextByte = NextByte XOR SecretNumber
    Put #2, ,NextByte
  Loop

  Close #1, #2
End Sub

[Client]

Sub DecryptImage(ImageFile)
  Dim NextByte

  Open ImageFile For Binary As #1
  Open Bitmap.bmp For Binary As #2

  Do While Not EOF(#1)
    Get #1, ,NextByte
    NextByte = NextByte XOR SecretNumber
    Put #2, ,NextByte
  Loop

  Close #1, #2
End Sub

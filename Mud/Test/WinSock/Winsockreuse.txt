What I do is make an array.
Make Socket(0) listening.
When it gets in a listening/accept event...
Ah.
That works if you want to make a game with one connection.
Just as long as you reset it to listen each time it disconnects.
Hehe.
Yep.
Okay...
What was I saying again? =)
Sorry, got lotsa people talking.
Okay..
What I do is make an ar with socket(0) listening.
When Socket(0) triggers the listen/accept event, whatever the control has...
Accept to Socket(1)...
Then if another one connects..
Accept to socket(2).
And in form_load...
Do this.
Dim Temp as integer
For Temp = 1 to PlayerCount(Whatever max players you want)
Load Socket(Temp)
Next

Then when server accepts..
Do this.
Dim Temp1 as integer
For Temp1 = 1 not Socket(Temp1).Connected(Or however you check to see if it's connected) then Socket(Temp1).Accept = ID
Something along those lines.
Just make it accept to a new, unconnected socket each time, and make sure it's not already listening or connected.
And to make it reusable, check if it's connected property is true if it has one.
If it doesn't have one, do like this:
When it accepts, have an array like
SocketConnected(1 to PlayerCount) as integer


Socket(Temp1).Accept = ID
SocketConnected(Temp1) = True

And to check
for Temp = 1 to PlayerCount
Inot SockConnected(Temp) then Socket(Temp).Accept = ID
Get the picture? =)

That'll allow multiple plus reusable.
Oh thanks, no prob. =)
Good luck. =)
I still wanna show ya SSL though. =)
Wonder what that device prob is.
The only thing I can think of that crashed you in Odyssey that I put into SSL to crash you is Domain lookup.
I made it Ikedasoft.dyn.ml.org instead of actually getting my direct IP fro
Okay, sorry, sure. =)

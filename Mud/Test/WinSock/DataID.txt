Do some char like ÿ where people can't type and don't allow them to type it.
Do like
instr(String, "!") + 1 tuh.

Do
loop until instr(string, "!") = false

And in it..
Dim Command as string
Command = mid$(String, instr(String,LineString = mid$(Command, instr(Command, " ") + 1)
Command = left$(Command, instr(Command, " ") - 1)
That'll give linestring as the values to specify like X and Y coordinates of where player moves, and command string will be the command like !Move 100 100

Or like thi
Dim LineString as string
Dim DataString as string
Dim CommandString as string
Socket.ReadData to DataString
While instr(DataString, "!"
CommandString = left$(DataString, instr(DataString, " ") - 1)
LineString = mid$(DataString, instr(DataString, " ") + 1)

Check commands and data.

DataString = mid$(DataString, instr(mid$(DataString, 2), "!"))
WEnd

There ya go.
That'll cut out the !Whatever.
Give you the linestring.
Oh, and if you want to cut out the !s after commandstring, do insteada LineString = mid$(DataString, instr(DataString, " ") + 1)
do this:
LineString = mid$(DataString, instr(DataString, " ") + 1)
LineString = left$(LineString, instr(LineString, "!") - 1)
There ya go. =)
Then perform checking commands and doing corresponding events where I put it.
That's how I do anyways
Oh.
That'll make EOFs too.
So the socket won't halfway read data and do stuff.
Actually.
You might need an EOF still.
That'll help.
End of data.
Should be called EOD but they call them EOFs for some strange reason.

Like
!Move X### Y###+
+ can be the end char.
Want me to re-do a whole new code for that?
Actually, you don't need ! if you have an EOF.
The thing about EOFs that's so important is sometimes the sock can split u
Like uhh.
That just doesn't sound right to say might supposed to have to me.
Oh well.
It might suppose to send
!Move 100 200
But if the packet splits, it might do
!Move 100 2
And send 00 a few hundred milliseconds later.
Which can crash unless you have error-checking code and that's a pain.
The thing about EOFs is that you can wait until you receive

Move 100 200+
Until you actually start trying to move people.
Of course, shouldn't use any commonly used chars like + or !.
Use like Alt+0255.
=)

So...
When you send data...
Let's just say EOF is ! since I can type that faster.

Whenever sending data, send Command, a space, then data, then !.
To read it... Okay, here's a big set of codes.
Uh, never mind.
Socket_Read Events
Static DataRead as string
Dim LineString as string
Dim CommandString as string
Socket.ReadData to DataRead (However way you do it)

While Instr(DataRead, "!")
CommandString = left$(DataRead, instr(DataRead, " ") - 1)
LineString = mid$(DataRead, instr(DataRead, " ") + 1)
LineString = left$(LineString, instr(LineString, "!") - 1)

Do your checking here with command and line string.
--------------------------------------------------------
DataRead = mid$(DataRead, instr(DataRead, "!") + 1)
WEnd
End Sub

There ya go. =)
NP. =)
Done it like 200 times now, like stuck in my mind. =)
There are times when there is packet loss.. This is the scariest thing.
Sometimes for no reason, you send something, and it just doesn't return. =(
I still haven't figured out how to correct this, just been trying to work around data loss.
Usually faster servers don't get data loss though, so if you have a good server it should be very very rare if it ever happens at all.
Mine's a 28.8 though, so kinda scary.
Oh, I mean the ISP mainly.
If it's a LAN, I doubt there'll be any data loss.
56K should be pretty good. =)
I'm not sure about VB 5 controls.
It might be so good that they already did auto data-loss correction.
Wow, I need to get VB 5 then. =)
Or I mean I got it, but I need to use it.
Maybe next game.

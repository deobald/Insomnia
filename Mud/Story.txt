
Nothing. There is nothing. And there will always be nothing. Not in this world, not in your world, and not in 'the real world'. What is our world, other than interminable nothingness? It is but a void, which has been filled. Time is not an issue, for it was not time that filled the void, instead, it was the void itself. That is our world and all that it stands for. However, there is another world.... one not made of nothing, but rather, made not of anything.

This world is the Paradox. The Dream Realm. The universe of the unreal...of the imagination. It was filled with time. Filled by beings who so boldly crossed the line into this unreal realm to make their home there. Known as the Illuminati now, they were then known as the wanderers. Their path led them to the glory that is the Paradox - and the pain. With bare hands they created the world to which you now venture. And for that, they are its keepers. Beware this world, and all it has to offer. But also know of its riches...

"Whaaa? Don't mention that in here!!! The Paradox isn't a joke, sonny. It's where we all live. And where we're ruled. But one day you can be ruler, boy. If that's whatcha want. Not many people do, though. Personally, the life of the common folk is pretty good. The....beings don't touch us.

> The.....beings?

"Yah...the Illuminati. They don't act real high-and-mighty, like you'd expect. Unless, 'course, you try an' meddle in their affairs...then they get touchy. Though it hasn't happened in 15 years, I once saw a man slowly and painfully electrified to death by the Wife of Xian. It was gawd-awful, son. You don't want to see it happen - ever.

"Speakin' of which - that woman. She's gone now. It's rumored that she lost her temper (as did happen quite frequently when she was still around) and lost her concentration when making a drink for herself. After she took it, she was never the same. She went completely MAD. She locked herself away from Xian and everyone for a full year, studying magiks and swordcraft. When she emerged, she made an attempt on her Husband's life. She was mighty, but she was also drawn from a mortal. Xian and Sabin are the only two absolutely PURE Illuminati ...that I know of. Anyway, Xian has her locked away in a crystal which will shatter when he finds a new soul for his lost wife. At that point, the crystal will shatter.

"Oh, but there is one other who may be pure. It's hard to say. Sabin's wife, Lady. She is of pure blood, but no one knows for sure if she was a wanderer when Paradox was first found. She's a nice lass, I'll give her that. But for some reason, many people fear her. She's mysterious in her beauty and charisma. And it's frightening to the ignorant. If you're to  meet her, don't ask favors. But she will engage in conversation, if you're patient. But don't think for a second that you're worthy of her beauty. Some of the most powerful, handsome men have tried for her hand. Her vows to Sabin are as tightly held as their love for each other, and Lord Xian will enforce them.....violently.

>Is he always...?

"Nah...he's a decent huma-, er.... He's a likable fellow. He and Lord Sabin both. However, disturbing their world in a way they don't care for will result in action on their part. Aside from that, they're mild-mannered. Though somewhat elusive. Xian will even come in here with Sabin and Lady and sit down with me and have a drink! Not many people can say that, around these parts. 'Cept those new to this world. The meak always get the most attention. Perhaps they will speak with you. Haw haw!!!

>I BEG your pardon?

"I'm just kidding with ya, son. Entertainment can get rather dry in the bar sometimes. Is there anything you need to know of this world other than the Lords?

-----------------------------------------------------
Our existance is overseen by the infinitisimally large number of worlds - both real and 
imaginary. Surrounding these worlds are Realms, and surrounding the Realms are Verses. We 
frequently pass from the two Verses... The Verse of Reality, known as the Universe, and
the Verse of Unreality, which is nameless. Every time we close our eyes, our mind takes us 
to the Unreal Verse. It has been this way since the creation of Time.

Yet.... once there was time, there was <I>change</I>. Change meant instability. And, 
for the first time, with the instability, a new Verse was formed from the chaos. It was 
not Reality or Unreality. It was a land between the waking and dreaming worlds. However,
accessing it meant you must travel to the realmof the dreaming first. The world was different
from Reality and Dreams....It was pure. Though not without war, famine, love, hatred, and 
chaos - it was pure. This is Paradox.

The first to venture here through the realms of dreams found nothing here but pain and 
suffering. But like pioneers of new-found land, they used the energy which flowed so greatly 
from his realm and crafted worlds. They soon realized that the power they had and the 
worlds they created would eventually be discovered. And so a pact was formed. They were 
to use their knowledge and power to stablize the world. Chaos would still exist. And all 
other things. But the world would remain as they created it. They limited exploration of 
this vast realm they had made to one world: Targus. Though these beings, these....
Illuminati....are rumored to have left gates open to other worlds in Paradox, you and I 
shall most likely stay close to home. In Targus.

<P>And who <I>are</I> these Illuminati that all beings fear and idolize? They are more than 
the average being but still mortal in the sense that their existance may ceace. However, they 
are immortal by lifespan - or at least an incomprehensible number of years do they live. 
Yet, for all their power, they are few. In fact, the original Illuminati number only two... 
Xian and Sabin. Once 'lesser' beings, like you and I, they still maintain emotion and 
thought. They are not Gods, though they create worlds and many revear them as such. They 
dislike even the term "Illuminati". They perfer the mortal clan name, DragonLord, to which 
they were born. Meet them and perhaps they will speak with you. Perhaps, if a friendship 
is found between you, even make you one of them through re-birth. However, you must 
<I>never</I> request for them to dabble in your affairs, lest you be smitten by them.

<P>The world is created. And is intended for you to experience. So go now, live within 
Paradox. Rule lands, find artifacts, sell your wares, cast spells, buy a home, fight off 
oppressors. Search the lands for treasures as rare as the spell of Dragon Mist, and as
common as the small, furry Schmoo. Do so for the sake of doing so. Because you must.</P>

<P>If you have an idea to add to this list of Player's Ideas, please
<A HREF="mailto:std@leo.net.gull-lake.sk.ca">drop Xian a line</A>. Ideas a separated by 
small lines.</P>

<HR Width=100%>

<P>The world is Targus. You have stumbled upon it through 
an accidental dabbling in magiks, and are now engrossed in 
its majestics. You find yourself yearning to learn and expand 
your knowledge, so you may explore the deepest, darkest 
corners of this realm...</P>

<Center><HR Width="50%"></Center>

<H2>How the game could look and work:</H2>

<P>
You look like a small person, very similar to a Final Fantasy character.
You walk around in real time with other 
people, and fight in real-time too (NOT like Final Fantasy), like Legend 
of Zelda, or Secret of Mana. You can collect items, send and recieve 
"game mail", form guilds, go on quests, learn spells and techniques, and 
kill enemy and player alike. However, to kill other players (PK), you 
must first issue a "Challenge Command". If they decline, you can't kill 
them! Curses and certain spells can be cast on other players without 
challenging however. So, you won't get killed because some jerk decided 
he didn't like your face. PKing has a time and a place. (There will also 
be an arena.) If you have a problem with another character, talk to one 
of The Illuminati (Gods) about it.</P>

<P>
The screen won't be cluttered with a bunch of controls, as with 
most games. You will have the view area, and the chat area, but that's it. 
You'll type in commands (like F2 for Inventory, and F3 for Spells), and the 
game will respond more like a console game (Nintendo/Sega). Some commands are as follows:
</P>

<LI>F1: Help
<LI>F2: Inventory
<LI>F3: Spells
<LI>F4: Mail
<LI>/h - Help
<LI>/i - Inventory
<LI>/s - spells
<LI>/m - mail
<LI>/calli - Calls an Illuminati (God) to you. Exessive use of this command will result in banishment from GateWay.
<LI>More coming soon!

<Center><HR Width="50%"></Center>

<H2>Some Rules/Ethics</H2>

<LI>Do not continually pester people to fight. If they don't want to fight, 
they don't have to.
<LI>NO SPAMMING (Saying a LOT, or saying the same thing OVER AND OVER...)
<LI>Cussing is frowned upon. Words like Hell and damn are acceptable ONCE 
OR TWICE (that is, ever). 4-letter words beginning with F and S are only 
okay if you're talking with tells to a friend. They are NEVER allows in 
full-game shouts, says, or yells.
<LI>Any abuse of bugs not meant to be in the game (ask to see if they are 
or not) will result in IMMEDIATE banishment from the game.
<LI>Abuse of the "Call Illuminati" feature will result in immidiate 
banishement (abuse means, more than twice, or using it for unnessicary 
reasons)
<LI>CONSISTANTLY bothering people with no-challenge spells and curses 
will result in being dealt with by an Illuminati.
<LI>If you're not clear on a rule, ask. There is usually an Illuminti on.

<Center><HR Width="50%"></Center>

<H2>"The Dream World"</H2>

<P>Entering the game is the equivalent of falling asleep. Once asleep, you live 
an entirely different life from that you live now...within the MUD. Governmets, 
nobles, kings, queens, working class, mages, and warriors will make up a massive 
world.</P>

<P>It will be a top-down view game, and look kinda like Secret of Mana. Dead bodies 
will retain items, and people can steal those items. However, the owner of the body 
will know (once he finds his body and gets back in it) who stole what items.</P>

<Center><HR Width="50%"></Center>

<H2>General Notes</H2>

<LI> No PK-ing. Only challenging.
<LI> All players can use magic
<LI> You can buy yur own house w/o contacting "gods"
<LI> You can summon beasts
